Talofa lava, malo soifua, ma le lagi mama aiga uma o Moananu! Greetings to all our Moananu family! This is a designated gathering place for family and a resource for connecting to our past.

## Roots
Come find your place in the family tree and let our roots run together. A "gafa" (ngah-fah) is a tree branch and symbolizes family history, origin, and ancestry. To "fai lou gafa" is to literally research your family geneology.

1. Create a free account at [familysearch.org](https://www.familysearch.org/)
2. Contribute your family pedigree
3. Link to a common ancestor of Moananu
4. Share family stories
